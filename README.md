This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


I made some mistakes on the decision making of this challenge, first i didnt knew if the correct way
would be using class components or functional components. 
I decided also to refactor to typscript and 
upgrade most of the packages, it worked fine. Other mistake i did was not make a figma prototype, i wasted a lot of time doing and redoing stuff, I also wasted sometime studying classes on react(not wasted but the challenge could be finished earlier),  but i am satisfied with the result, somethings could be improved like wrapping some components and export to reuse.
#### The infinite scroll I decided to use the lib https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller.
